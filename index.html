            <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effect Demonstration</h2>
            <p>Parallax is the apparent displacement of an object because of a change in the observer's point of view.
                Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex
                cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. 
                Many animals, along with humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax 
                to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis. 
                In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a 
                device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in some variations also 
                altitude to a target. <br><br>
